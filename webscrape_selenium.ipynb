In the said G.O., while granting one stage accelerated promotion, the Government ordered creation of 748 supernumerary posts in order to accommodate those who are accorded accelerated promotion by specifically indicating that those 748 supernumerary posts sanctioned were person oriented and shall lapse whenever the incumbents vacate the posts on retirement from service or otherwise.\\n In G.O.Ms.No.1346 Home dated 06.12.2004, Government also granted accelerated promotion to 159 Special Task Force police personnel and granted cash award of Rs.2,00,000/- to each including the Appellants herein, who served in the Special Task Force.

The details of names of personnel, their present rank and the rank to which they are promoted/appointed are as shown in the Annexure to this order.\\n Thus, we need to consider as to whether there are equals and if so, whether the element of discrimination is apparent in this case. Even though, we are not called upon to decide as to whether the accelerated promotions given on these Appellants are valid or not, as the Appellants seek further benefit of seniority in the accelerated promoted cadre, incidentally, we need to examine as to whether such promotion given to those persons are made in such a way to confer the seniority benefit also as a matter of right.\\n37. Thus, we need to consider as to whether there are equals and if so, whether the element of discrimination is apparent in this case.

Executive instructions cannot override the statutory rules. If the accelerated promotees are given seniority in the higher cadre it will affect the promotion of the person senior to the accelerated promotees in the lower cadre and it will lead to the situation of reduction of rank of their seniors in the lower category and the same is contrary to General Rule 35(a) and 35(aa) and natural justice which will affect the morale of the entire police force.\\n95. Accelerated promotion analogous to promotion given to reserved candidates:-\\nMr.R.Muthukumaraswamy, learned Senior Counsel submitted that in cases of accelerated promotion accorded basing on the rule of reservation superseding others, who were seniors in the feeder category, as per decision of the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court in AJIT SINGH AND OTHERS (II) VS. STATE OF PUNJAB AND OTHERS, (1999) 7 SCC 209, the seniors will rank above the accelerated promotees on reaching that promotional post. Learned Senior counsel submitted that even for the accelerated promotion based on the constitutional mandate of following the rule of reservation, when the seniors will catch up their original seniority, the accelerated promotees, in the present case who got accelerated promotion by means of executive orders, cannot claim consequential seniority in the higher position.\\n98. The same analogy of promotion is given to the reserved roster point promotees and that their seniors will catch up the original seniority will apply to the present case of accelerated promotees.\\n100. Option for joining Special Task Force not sought for from the police and therefore, grant of seniority to accelerated promotees would amount to discrimination of equals:- The Government in its own appreciation of bravery service rendered by those chosen persons, who were in the S.T.F, thought fit to grant accelerated promotion in preference to other persons of the same class.\\n105. Point No.8:-\\nChallenge to G.O.Ms.No. 332 Home Department Dated 3.5.2012:\\n(i) W.P.(MD) No.8911 of 2012 - The case of the petitioner is that he was selected for appointment to the post of Sub-Inspector of Police by direct Recruitment on merits and he joined service in 1987-1988. He was promoted to the post of Inspector of Police in the year 1997 and then to the post of Deputy Superintendent of Police in the year 2008.\\n(ii) W.P.No. 17731 of 2012 - These petitioners were selected for appointment to the post of Sub-Inspector of Police by direct recruitment on merits and they have joined service in 1987-1988. They were promoted to the post of Inspector of Police and then to the post of Deputy Superintendent of Police. In the said post they are continuously working till this date.\\n(iii) W.P.No. 20728 of 2012 - The petitioners herein are working as Inspectors of Police and they were recruited as Sub-Inspectors of Police between 1996 and 1999. They were promoted as Inspector of Police on 8.4.2005; 25.9.2010, 13.4.2005; and on 2.7.2010 respectively. They were promoted on the basis of their seniority in the cadre of Sub-Inspector of Police and they are awaiting promotion to the post of Deputy Superintendent of Police.\\n106. All these three writ petitions were filed challenging G.O.Ms.No. 332 dated 3.5.2012. They are all aggrieved against restoration of consequential seniority to the accelerated promotees.\\n114. All the contentions of respective parties, with regard to grant of accelerated promotion and the consequential seniority have been considered by us, supra, while deciding the writ appeals and other connected writ petitions. Therefore, those findings hold good to these writ petitions also. Hence, we are not reiterating those findings once again. In these writ petitions, we are only deciding with regard to the propriety of the Government in passing G.O.Ms.No.332 during the pendency of the writ appeals.\\n115. On careful analysis of all these submissions and pleadings, following questions arise for consideration in these writ petitions:-\\n1.Whether the stay granted by the Division Bench empowers the Government to take a decision on the same subject matter independently ?\\n2.Whether the decision taken to cancel clause 5(e) in G.O.Ms.No.1396 dated 3.10.2007, the subject matter in writ appeals, is a proper action on the part of the Government and whether a dispute, which is subjudice, can be a subject matter of a Government Order taking a parallel decision independently ?\\n3.Whether the Government\\'s action in cancelling clause 5(e) in G.O.Ms.No. 1396 dated 3.10.2007 , which was upheld by the learned single Judge and further being tested before the Division Bench, is in effect not as sitting over the judgment of the learned single Judge, especially under the circumstances where the Government had not chosen to challenge the same by filing any writ appeals ?\\n4.Whether the action of the Government in passing G.O. 332, in effect, is not nullifying the order of the learned single Judge, especially when the said action is not in the form of making or amending any legislation ?\\n5.Whether the writ petitions filed are liable to be rejected for non-joinder of necessary parties and whether such objection can be raised without there being a pleading to that effect ?\\n138. Without going into all these aspects, we could have set aside G.O.Ms.No. 332 dated 3.5.2012, by simply holding so in view of our findings and decision rendered in the above writ appeals. Yet, we would like to express our dismay and displeasure over the action of the Government in hurriedly passing G.O.Ms.No.332 without even waiting for the decision in the writ appeals. Therefore, we are of the view that in all fairness G.O.Ms.No.332 dated 3.5.2012 ought not to have been passed by the Government . Consequently, we have no hesitation in holding that G.O.Ms.No.332 dated 3.5.2012 is invalid and passed without any competency. Accordingly, the same is liable to be quashed.\\n139. Conclusion:-\\nW.A.Nos.849 to 854 and 2066 of 2010:\\nAccelerated promotion was without reference to the statutory rules or G.O.Ms.No.468, Home, dated 19.3.1996. The appellants and other police personnel were not promoted to the substantive posts but were accommodated by creation of supernumerary posts. Since there was ambiguity over panel position of the accelerated promotees vis-a-vis regular promotees, considering the representation given by the police officers, Government rightly issued G.O.Ms.No.1396 Home dated 3.10.2007 deleting paragraph No.5(e) in G.O.Ms.No.1252, Home, dated 29.10.2004 and G.O.Ms.No.1346, Home, dated 6.12.2004. Government was well within its powers in deleting Paragraph No.5(e) in G.O.Ms.No.1252, Home, dated 29.10.2004 and G.O.Ms.No.1346, Home, dated 6.12.2004 and clarifying the position by substituting a new one in G.O.Ms.No.1396, Home, dated 3.10.2007 restoring the original seniority. The learned single Judge rightly dismissed the Writ Petitions and we do not find any infirmity in the order of the learned single Judge warranting interference and all the Writ Appeals are dismissed. The order of status quo granted on 2.8.2012 is vacated.\\nConsequently, the Writ Petitions in W.P.Nos.25736 to 25741 of 2010 are dismissed.\\n140. W.P.Nos.17731, 20728 of 2012 and W.P.(MD) No.8911 of 2012: The impugned G.O.Ms.No.332 Home (Pol.1A) Department dated 03.5.2012 had directly dealt with the subject matter pending before the Division Bench sitting over the judgment of the learned single Judge. The grant of stay in Writ Appeals will not confer any right on the Government to pass the impugned G.O. Ms.No.332 Home (Pol.1A) Department dated 03.5.2012 independently and the impugned G.O.Ms.No.332 Home (Pol.1A) Department dated 03.5.2012 is quashed and all these Writ Petitions are allowed. No costs.\\nConsequently, connected Miscellaneous Petitions in all the Writ Appeals and in all the Writ Petitions shall stand dismissed.\\nusk/bbr To\\n1.
